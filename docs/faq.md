##What can I do with DataTP framework?##
DataTP framework currently focus on the web crawler and web data analysis. It will soon move to support the other data source such log data, facebook data.

With the web crawler, you can:
* Configure and crawler to crawl the webpages from the specific sites, optimize the configuration to fetch only the pages you interest
* Extract the important data such title, description, content from the article; product description, price from a merchandise page... You can
extract the data either by configuring the xpath or use the automation algorithm such measuring the text density, 
similarity of the title and anchor text, by using the keywords to identify the interested section...
* Clean, normalize or transform the data. Even if data is extracted correctly from web pages, the data may not be readily consumable. 
It may require further clean(remove the related link, advertizing...), normalize  and transform(eg the price, address, phone number)

With the webui, you can:

* Admin and monitor the web crawler
* Search, analyze and visualize the data
